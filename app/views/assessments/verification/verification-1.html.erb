              <p>Knowledge-based verification (KBV) is when you ask someone questions that only the person they're claiming to be would know the answer to. 
                 The questions should be about things that you can also find the answer to.</p>
              <p>For example, you could ask the person how much their monthly mortgage payments are. To be able to answer this, they'll need a mortgage 
                 (they would have had to prove their identity to get one) and have bills that were sent to their address.</p>
              <p>You could also make a zero balance transaction into their bank account and attach a reference number (which is valid for a short period of time) 
                 to it. This will show up as a code on their bank statement. If they give you the correct code, it will prove the person youâ€™re dealing with has control of and access to that bank account.</p>
