              Do you check if the interactions you've found are interactions you'd expect users to have?

          <p>
            Some peopleâ€™s interactions might appear differently to others. The interactions you expect someone to have will usually depend on:
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the type of interaction</li>
            <li>who they are (their interactions can depend on things like their age or financial situation)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, you can expect someone who's been working for 20 years to have frequent financial transactions, but someone who's recently left school might not.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can't find interactions that happen in the way you'd expect for that person, you might be less sure they were actually involved in them.
